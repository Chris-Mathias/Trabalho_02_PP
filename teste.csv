What can we believe?, help me to know this is real. (CHORUS) If I give it all, if I give it all away. We could have it all, we could have it all this way.

If you love me say that you need me, I'll give my love to you. Broken dreams are never really what they seem, Somewhere in between you can give all your troubles to me. I don't know how far we are meant to go, If you tell me so that is where I want to be. (CHORUS) If I give it all, if I give it all away. We could have it all, we could have it all this way.

With the rain came freedom, never was one more word so true In the ragged morning then the word came alive in you And I tried, and I tried for you It's not easy, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you. All the food that we could buy wasn't enough to keep just one alive. But we came through summer letting autumn close your eyes. And I tried, and I tried for you.
